# obsidian-utils

## Welcome to the docs

This documentation is generated by [tsdoc](https://github.com/xperiments/TSDoc) and [typedoc-plugin-markdown](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typedoc-plugin-markdown). Edits shouldn't be made directly anywhere in the `/docs` directory as it's all auto generated.

## Getting started

The best place to start is by looking at the [module documentation](modules/obsidian_utils.md) which where everything is ultimately exported.
