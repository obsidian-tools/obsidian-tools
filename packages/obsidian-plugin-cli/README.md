```
USAGE
  $ obsidian-plugin build [ENTRYPOINT]

OPTIONS
  -e, --esbuild-override=esbuild-override  path to a JSON file over esbuild options to enhance/override the current
                                           build

  -h, --help                               show CLI help

```

_See code: [src/commands/build.ts](https://github.com/zephraph/obsidian-tools/blob/v0.4.0/src/commands/build.ts)_

## `obsidian-plugin dev [ENTRYPOINT]`

builds in watch mode and copies output to a specified vault for testing

```
USAGE
  $ obsidian-plugin dev [ENTRYPOINT]

OPTIONS
  -e, --esbuild-override=esbuild-override  path to a JSON file over esbuild options to enhance/override the current
                                           build

  -h, --help                               show CLI help

  -n, --no-prompts                         disable prompting for user input

  -v, --vault-path=vault-path              path to the obsidian vault you want to develop in

DESCRIPTION
  If --vault-path is not specified, this command will try to intelligently determine where your vaults are located.
  If it's able to locate your vaults, you'll be given the option to select which vault you'd like to develop against.
  If, however, --no-prompts is passed it will assume the last opened vault (if one is found) will be the vault to
  develop
  against. If that's not the behavior you desire, ensure to pass the explicit path to the vault you want to develop
  against
  with --vault-path.
```
